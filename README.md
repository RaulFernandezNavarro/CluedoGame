# CluedoGame
A complete Java programmed clue game for solving a crime scene. The game is played through interaction with its user interface and has embedded pictures and videos. This game was programmed as a Birthday gift, and hence, all the pictures, videos and the general storyline was personalized for the main player. Due to this, and for privacy reasons, **ALL THE IMAGE AND VIDEO FILES WILL NOT BE UPLOADED TO THE REPOSITORY**, since they contain pictures of friends and relatives. The executable .jar file has not been uploaded either for the same reasons.
